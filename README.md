HyHy
====
HyHy is [Hy](https://github.com/hylang/hy) rewritten entirely in Hy itself.

It depends on an external Hy image to interpret its Hy (\*.hy) core,
and runs a HyHy script (\*.hyhy) which has the identical syntax and functionality
of Hy.

The Hy code is entirely automatically generated by [py2hy](https://github.com/woodrush/py2hy),
with a version of a refactored version of Hy. The refactorization consists of
of eliminating Hy reserved keywords such as `require`, `eval`, etc., and
renaming `hy` to `hyhy`.

Installation
------------
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Usage
-----
It is usable just like Hy:
```bash
hyhy *.hyhy
```
